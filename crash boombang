4:58:32
because i oh [ __ ] where is it oh maybe adam can that
4:58:38
is coming up uh oh [ __ ]
4:58:44
oh you did that that's all right then alberto is the sentiment king ting
4:58:52
you're the king king alberto what's
4:59:22
how's everyone else yeah great we've just lost the plot i think the
4:59:27
internet is uh like definitely
4:59:33
um messed up weird i mean yeah like we can't communicate
4:59:39
like i don't i'm not sure what to do um at this point
4:59:48
i sent that to myself i blocked myself in twitter my in my account within so i
4:59:54
cannot send him to myself into it yeah i think that's the question
5:00:01
somebody help me i'm insane right i a month ago posted that gib huh github was
5:00:07
being hacked uh specifically the twitter depository of uh
5:00:13
because and chirp is coming up in november but the contest is going on right now all the entries and so
5:00:20
somebody wants someone to win i wonder who that is that's pretty uh difficult to figure out
5:00:27
when you say heck things can be added to this are you saying that
5:00:36
uh what there was an ai that was
5:00:42
i mean i have a whole thing on i mean i put in their articles about like backed up by looping computer
5:00:48
um so chirp is going on in november but the contest the the entries are right now
5:00:55
so all of a sudden the news magically appears now the the the final date for entry for uh
5:01:04
the api for for uh if you've created something for api is um
5:01:09
august 19th but it happens in november a month ago i've been screaming this
5:01:18
um i i know who it is i i know exactly who's involved i know they're picking
5:01:23
winners and losers and it's ridic and it's making me sick i knew it a year ago
5:01:30
but it sounds like you have to be like on the inside of the contest for that right no you have to have on the inside
5:01:36
basically someone on twitter who they've taken off the api team
5:01:42
um or they're not even allowed in spaces anymore when they hold spaces and then the person who when i brought it up last
5:01:50
month in july magically was on vacation in august i wonder why that was
5:01:57
um i mean maybe it was a vacation i guess it's august i don't know but
5:02:03
it was in like the whole thing was ridiculous it was like i i i know who who's who's gonna win i
5:02:10
already i can tell you right now is going to win this conference i'm sorry for not paying attention to the
5:02:16
what you were saying earlier like last month or whatever but um
5:02:22
i'm telling you that twitter is compromised i i believe you i'm just asking for like some details on how they
5:02:28
game the the thing i can i can force feed you
5:02:34
what news shows up in your feed no matter what that i just was asking is there like
5:02:40
details on how they were doing it but yeah i can look yeah articles well just just look at your dm look at your dm
5:02:47
okay i wasn't trying to be hostile or i would just want to oh no i'm just pissed i'm
5:02:52
just pissed off i i i went to the ceo i'm i'm done i'm done with this [ __ ]
5:02:58
well i mean to think that you know there's a correction in some way
5:03:03
they're doing it to account for 10 million people who have reach and they're putting out stuff that means
5:03:08
like is absolute absolute garbage they've spread like the general disinformation
5:03:14
right and they've been infected american elections several times now and you know i mean
5:03:21
they're awful yeah i mean yeah i mean and there were twitter there
5:03:27
it's on my timeline they did a poll um who do you trust the most what social
5:03:33
media do you trust most for um news twitter
5:03:38
was like 900 received 90 yep but yeah
5:03:44
who else would it be like for breaking news there's only one place
5:03:50
and i'm gonna tell you right now who i i oh i'm not gonna say the name but alberto knows who i think it is
5:03:58
but he's like not like a will like he's unwillingly involved in it
5:04:05
it's the whole thing is messed up and this isn't an ss7 thing purposely
5:04:13
left open to like get information out just in case or like read people's news feeds or whatever this is this is this
5:04:20
is way beyond that this is like literally changing the news and
5:04:26
countries this is major so um
5:04:32
people the people who control twitter the narrative like that is the big prize because like
5:04:37
yeah a lot right there's a lot of effect you can have like power tons of power in that so yeah
5:04:46
it makes sense that people would be going for it right exactly i blame the capital so alberto
5:04:54
no this is not capitalism this is actual dictatorship uh
5:05:02
power vacuum or trying to control them at the top of the mountain or where i blame i am danielle from uh a twitter
5:05:10
api i blame a number of he's not even allowed to host the api uh
5:05:17
twitter spaces anymore because he did it without permission last year or two years whenever they
5:05:23
started i blame um
5:05:28
who else there's a lot of people but i if i went
5:05:34
down the list i'd probably be the platform so the ceo can decide what he wants to do i mean we're going to web through anyway
5:05:40
soon i mean the question is like
5:05:46
what effect will happen before we go to web of three
5:05:52
like like how much will they be able like will certain entities be able to um
5:05:58
change before i mean like and when you think
5:06:04
yeah that's just kind of that's another they can mean a lot of things so i mean
5:06:11
that replaces you know in a decentralized way maybe hopefully uh what twitter does but
5:06:18
yeah how that is implemented would it really doesn't matter
5:06:25
it really does matter
5:06:30
and i was like i don't know what 3.0 um
5:06:35
choosing i mean okay you have uh it's web 3.0 will happen overnight the
5:06:42
solutions won't be created tomorrow uh but at the end if you have the solutions
5:06:49
there anyway uh what people chooses the perception of people what they're going to select is
5:06:56
not the best thing is what they think is the coolest thing to use
5:07:03
so web 3.0 doesn't mean the end of certain things like
5:07:10
things that are bad or wrong just because people might perceive no
5:07:15
this is the cool thing i love this everybody used to tic toc
5:07:20
everybody particularly school uh doesn't matter anything else
5:07:27
yeah there are um privacy focused um twitter alternatives right now that
5:07:32
nobody's using because everybody's on twitter and then don't
5:07:37
they haven't there's no impetus to move right so we could move over to a place that would protect and sense not censor and
5:07:44
do these things like adam's talking about them yeah but people care about that people are
5:07:50
actually aware of what what it means i mean
5:07:55
do they care do they understand what it means and
5:08:01
do you really are able to say no
5:08:08
i'm building up here i'm going to this place because
5:08:13
there's no way i'm staying here or oh yeah why would that move i mean
5:08:19
something yeah it's gonna get worse like the reason that everybody left myspace was um you know the
5:08:25
doctor of the ui sector you know there's got to be a reason uh your better product actually does come around you
5:08:33
know it's not about better it's not about being better
5:08:38
but being better is not the thing that is the winner and something
5:08:45
it's not a an element that
5:08:51
defines a winner or what people the whatever is doesn't mind
5:08:57
by other factors that if you can manipulate people
5:09:03
the winner will be defined by those people that are being manipulated
5:09:16
um november happens to be midterm elections in
5:09:22
the united states so um that's a problem because
5:09:31
if this isn't patched which it's not
5:09:36
um yet so
5:09:44
what exactly can they do with it there was an ai there was basically an ai re going through all
5:09:51
of github and had full access to everything
5:10:02
um i didn't ask for a bugatti nothing like i i gave him the full way to fix it i'm like all right
5:10:09
microsoft owns github right just please fix thing
5:10:17
exposely is fixed well okay
5:10:23
but what got out before that is also the problem
5:10:28
and then which is the article i said which was article used at me samantha yesterday i
5:10:33
was just showing us that now i'm bleeping um and then
5:10:39
so we have midterm elections in november and so ninety percent of people
5:10:45
believing what they read on twitter if i force feed everyone certain news
5:10:52
i can effectively change who they vote for in any race i want
5:11:01
now i'm not saying that there's um the whole united states is on twitter
5:11:06
but there are a lot of people with a lot of um power
5:11:12
that if they read it they believe it especially if there's that blue
5:11:17
it's the influencer like the people who then go out and write the articles and the news stuff that we're all on twitter
5:11:27
i just weren't fair well
5:11:34
to something that i mentioned days ago um in trailer okay
5:11:41
uh i don't think people are smart enough to actually uh
5:11:47
re be aware of what you are aware you have been aware
5:11:53
and uh what's going on everybody's stupid or everybody's corrupt
5:12:00
that's what i can't figure out jane wong reverse engineered it
5:12:05
i have been tweeting about this all summer um
5:12:11
i did receive responses but like i don't see the fixes because there's
5:12:17
too many entities too many of the tech comp like so like okay if there's an opening here
5:12:25
ah people left companies and gone to private companies and got stock options it's all it i was told two years ago
5:12:33
that i was right on the money and i should tell people well tell who
5:12:38
so the ceo left prague was the cto he is
5:12:44
fully aware he he he can he can fight this he can fix it so i'm hoping he's
5:12:50
working on it uh well yeah
5:13:07
i was going to ask why github um the ai that uh github is a code the software you
5:13:14
know uh repository um but uh right so that's where you had a
5:13:21
uh that's where um in order to enter the
5:13:26
contest for uh all these different for for chirp uh which is
5:13:34
twitter's um god
5:13:39
it's all these different apps that
5:13:44
are out there and um [Music] you had to disclose all your code if you
5:13:51
were to enter and therefore
5:13:56
so they thought they fixed it right they're like oh well just we'll just do this and put it here
5:14:03
but no that didn't work it already had been leaked it was
5:14:08
already out there so [Music]
5:14:13
um it's been and that's the thing what what you said
5:14:20
alberto it's like no you're they're not it's um i don't
5:14:26
know i can't figure out why it's not being fixed
5:14:32
aware of it yeah which means that they're in on it right like they're
5:14:37
either in cahoots or they they or one informed people like you know it doesn't take the
5:14:44
whole company it takes one or two people yeah that's right yeah
5:14:49
but they can't deny that they know about it now and the fact that they haven't stopped it means either don't know how or that they don't
5:14:55
want to 100 uh
5:15:02
i brought it up two months ago i tweeted about it three months ago jane wong
5:15:07
reverse engineer the whole thing um
5:15:14
i i mean
5:15:20
they pick up they somehow get a winner for the contest but what is the contest um these apps are interact with twitter
5:15:26
to do what are they something specific or is just
5:15:31
at this point you you could be on a total separate app yeah still getting the feed
5:15:38
but getting a feed of yeah i mean you know knitter sometimes
5:15:43
no java um there's other there's other
5:15:53
apps that help people get tremendous amount of followers certain apps help people um
5:16:00
host algorithms what there's that that one from the
5:16:05
philippines there's that other one alberto uh let's not mention that any names right now
5:16:16
basically oh no we can't we're waiting to be attached to the turnpike because
5:16:21
it's not real barbara no andrew
5:16:26
i can get the transcriptions there now uh i didn't mention from where but uh
5:16:34
yeah it's all [ __ ] right i mean is there an app that can
5:16:40
help you get moved forward like in and actually works or is it i thought all that [ __ ] was scamming stuff like
5:16:45
they're just trying to scam you oh no this is real this is
5:16:51
well there's definitely scammers that are trying to do that like celia the what the secret way of
5:16:58
getting you know popular but uh how do the ones that work work do you
5:17:03
know um uh are we on twitter alberto right
5:17:11
now or are we through an app well i'm i'm using the phone app
5:17:18
no it doesn't matter what you're using and what matters what the host is using
5:17:24
you don't say the name of it just yeah okay
5:17:32
so that's what it is if the so then you have a number of um
5:17:38
[Music] we're blue stacks no
5:17:44
we're not gonna say while we're on it why not i'm not saying this is it i'm not saying
5:17:49
it's that one i'm not i'm just having that i'm not saying anything
5:17:55
in general there are apps you can run twitter spaces from there are apps you can listen to
5:18:02
keywords for you brands can figure out um
5:18:08
like let's just say coke and pepsi like so how to like you know change your advertising that's like a simplistic way
5:18:15
to explain it but it's much more devious than that it's so it's it's spaces
5:18:23
it's the timeline i can make sure you like i said see
5:18:30
exactly what i want you to see and it can be totally fake
5:18:36
so i mean i guess like if they don't care i don't know what to
5:18:41
do at this point i guess i don't know yeah from what i understand i do
5:18:46
i i know it's gonna happen but it will be too late okay
5:18:53
my understanding about time
5:19:00
sorry um the my understanding is my timeline is um you know uh
5:19:06
algorithmic uh whatever based upon the people i follow and the things the topics
5:19:12
but it's all stuff that i've chosen right how how is it that you'd be able to influence it
5:19:18
before before that sorry about one question um uh i mean laundry rather than this but
5:19:24
twitter being a public company having to comply with certain
5:19:30
regulations and is there any place where certain things
5:19:36
can be reported and should be verified as you sec
5:19:42
okay and the security exchange commitments they are
5:19:47
it's a fiduciary responsibility because basically they are committing their
5:19:52
shareholders i mean me if i buy
5:19:58
that's another place thing because they they're they're losing out on revenue yeah i mean they're listening to me
5:20:04
they're right if i'm i have a chair uh twitter they're lying to me i mean
5:20:10
i'm paying for something that is not true yeah
5:20:16
i mean i i bought something that is not what i bought i mean the
5:20:22
the stock price yeah i mean i i'm it's a public company
5:20:30
and they have a fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders to um
5:20:35
so like there's multiple ways that this will be handled it's just the midterms elections will
5:20:42
affect and happen by then and uh
5:20:49
yeah so um so is that
5:20:55
a way of uh keeping talking all this in
5:21:01
in in
5:21:14
regular twitter spaces is okay because i know the owners of the partner
5:21:23
that um watch for the keywords both the two companies
5:21:30
and they are closely watching one's out of luxembourg and once that one's out of uh
5:21:37
uh well canada and atlanta georgia um
5:21:42
and uh they're closely watching for everything um but you can sway
5:21:50
you know you know how close these these especially the midterms like come on now
5:21:55
like um and that determines right now we're in a very hostile i mean
5:22:01
i'm just i i don't want to see violence i you know
5:22:07
i just want everything to be peaceful like uh so yeah i mean it's been reported uh to the right people um
5:22:15
now whether they get to it in time um
5:22:22
how many things i bet i bet they yeah they have to comply with certain things they might be
5:22:30
subject to out auditory and bla bla but i bet at
5:22:37
the time of that are completely
5:22:43
calculated in order to oh yeah but it's too late
5:22:50
you will write that because it's important it's quarter it's quarterly audits and um
5:22:56
that's what we're looking at right now so
5:23:01
so you have quarterly audits and then they that they get everything gets audited
5:23:06
that gets turned in but it doesn't get turned in until months later so so every
5:23:12
three months there's an audit and um
5:23:19
it's yeah um
5:23:27
i had someone come into a space that threw everyone out i was hosting this this was like a year and a half ago
5:23:34
they threw every single person out i don't know how they did it
5:23:42
and they said to me um and they're on the board still
5:23:48
and they said to me you're 100 right keeps talking about what you're talking about you'll be protected you're fine
5:23:56
um and uh
5:24:02
one question do we know okay hi kaiko do we know you do we know her do we know
5:24:07
him follow me
5:24:14
i'll meet you ah now
5:24:19
oh yeah huh
5:24:25
i can vouch for this particular individual
5:24:33
is that coin's other uh
5:24:57
when i get kicked out of spaces i can't join with the same account it won't let me so i always switch accounts
5:25:17
no i'm just sorry i'm having some dramas this morning again so
5:25:23
sorry well don't worry the whole world's on fire i know you're not the only one
5:25:29
um no well i'm not now i'm having dramas with my kids and their dad
5:25:36
for a change ah baby daddy drama i've been on the phone
5:25:41
for ben for the last however many minutes but i've had him blocked since may but i had i had to i have had to
5:25:48
speak to him so because henry is just i don't know what's going on with him
5:25:54
but he's supposed to be at work with his dad but he's not he's still asleep in his
5:25:59
bed and i can't get him out of bed and he does this a little bit recently and i've been having trouble with getting
5:26:05
him to school and everything as well and um anyways
5:26:10
i took him out of bed
5:26:21
uh he's a teenager you can't be bothered
5:26:27
okay it's nothing you know it's just
5:26:33
just a stage isn't it but it's just it's just been
5:26:41
just pissing me off so sorry i'm a bit thingy today that's it's fine it's fine it's fine i'm just letting you know that
5:26:47
i'm sort of in and out i'm not really even when i'm i might be on mute but i haven't been listening because i've been
5:26:52
too busy you know what fun inside is that actually it's so
5:26:58
so so ironic but the solution to this is actually
5:27:04
it's actually it's quite a girl yeah no no no no
5:27:11
this can have this can be solved but actually solving this
5:27:16
wouldn't be theoretical and i mean right okay it can be solved
5:27:22
perfectly but okay
5:27:29
if no okay never mind but they have a solution but the solution is i think there's more
5:27:35
people on this twitter thing then we might perceive i mean there's there's another a new account that i'm
5:27:42
sure i shared with you the other day that jack guy who's doing some stuff
5:27:47
he's doing that out in the open it's
5:27:58
this is a problem okay uh make it disappear
5:28:03
and you can have wow i know but i think is that i think can you you can secure this problem
5:28:11
from from your end can't you as a as as a client
5:28:17
a computer as such if you know how to hmm
5:28:24
certain um like let's say you're on spaces right um
5:28:30
you have to log in certain ways and uh
5:28:35
i'm sure it's not easy and it's not for the regular user uh for the person that is going to
5:28:40
be selecting uh presses i don't think that person will be
5:28:48
anything like that to to to
5:28:54
bring them to the person that is going to be manipulated by the news and who is going
5:28:59
to take decision based on the news that person
5:29:05
are you generalizing when you say that person no i'm saying i mean my my mother if my mother was the
5:29:13
end user and she
5:29:23
yeah sorry but that's my that's what i'm saying that it's not that securing it is
5:29:29
not for the regular person but there are right the point that you always mentioned uh the end consumer uh
5:29:35
basically yeah they don't give a [ __ ] yeah well no they're just they're not it's
5:29:41
not it's not simple so therefore they can't implement right yeah
5:29:47
i get it that they're manipulating was it yes no not yesterday the day
5:29:54
before i had a thread of my dms between me and i was talking to someone um and
5:30:01
they were definitely hijacked three times
5:30:06
so it's definitely still a thing but interestingly the
5:30:12
uh by the way i'm i might crash anytime soon
5:30:17
which was odd and but wouldn't wouldn't i'm pretty sure my mic's not working
5:30:23
your mic is working coin we can hear you oh okay um
5:30:29
all right we're just talking about can you not hear us no but i i i'll ask a question and
5:30:35
nobody will be able to hear the internship just responded you dick yeah i can hear you
5:30:40
yeah oh i just assumed he's not broken i think alberto said he might crash
5:30:50
keep talking and working on that
5:30:55
i mean i'm super interested in this i would love to know more i i guess you guys aren't allowed to talk about it but
5:31:01
um i the chirp i should where should i start there and figure out what that
5:31:07
contest is and then maybe i'll understand what's happening now
5:31:12
where do i start so uh this goes back like two years uh
5:31:20
um we're talking about the some of the largest tech companies uh i
5:31:26
don't know the uh how to so i i have no place to start and i
5:31:31
can't understand it well if we were logged in
5:31:39
i don't think i just think coin is is reading too much into frustrating thinking we're being
5:31:44
secretive when we're not being secretive i ask a question you can't answer it
5:31:50
like the answer is i can't answer i understand
5:31:57
no we're we're on a platform that
5:32:03
i can't discuss this on this platform some third party software that's
5:32:10
collecting keywords now why can't can you explain why you can't
5:32:16
discuss it on the space because we're talking about twitter i mean yeah why uh hey twitter sucks hello twitter
5:32:23
i don't like you sorry we're not on twitter i'm on twitter
5:32:28
uh yeah
5:32:38
[Music] but you're not allowed to say the one that you guys are using okay fine um
5:32:49
you you're not on what you said you are on holding your hand something
5:32:54
that's where you are what what are you holding in your hands
5:33:00
are you in twitter
5:33:06
um i'm sorry i've got a cell phone using the twitter app
5:33:11
bingo was that not obvious
5:33:25
so when you have some of the largest companies in the world
5:33:30
that are compromised it's very difficult to talk about um
5:33:35
we saw what happened to one of our friends you're worried about your safety
5:33:43
i'm not okay trust i mean look you said it was hard to talk about
5:33:50
safety necessarily can you please
5:33:58
okay let's just say in general um [Music]
5:34:06
uh
5:34:16
in any way you i keep asking questions you can't answer how close was the election in
5:34:22
2000 very close okay another percentage
5:34:28
i understand it's like if you're able to manipulate twitter you would you could definitely swing close elections
5:34:34
600 people in florida and we have one studies
5:34:40
yeah oh yeah yeah and then they recounted the count miami-dade and it was all screwed up anyway so yeah
5:34:48
right so i know i definitely know history yeah
5:34:54
um so i have
5:34:59
received certain answers but the problem is they fixed the leak after the leak
5:35:06
happened what leak look at your dm
5:35:14
on your other account okay
5:35:25
just look at bleeping computer it was the one that samantha yeah call this tweet um
5:35:32
all right i've looked at the article yeah
5:35:41
like i summed it up very well and tagged all the major apartments and
5:35:48
heard back from one party developer
5:35:57
who's entered into chirp so um
5:36:02
like i don't know what's up is uh is he a tr what
5:36:09
i don't really know what chirp is i have to figure out what any and you're not allowed you can't talk about it on this
5:36:17
like what the point of the contest is what what they're trying to do and they
5:36:22
said they're gonna pick a winner but that i don't know what the end goal or what these apps are supposed
5:36:28
to do because people
5:36:33
okay i'm trying to look up chirp okay
5:36:40
how's your timeline been how many followers have you gained over the last six months
5:36:46
well not a lot i don't usually but i don't care about followers i don't go for
5:36:51
yeah i don't do anything to being followers no but like what are you even seeing like how do you know you're seeing the
5:36:57
right thing like i don't but that's what i said earlier
5:37:02
that my um timeline the things that i see which i have set to um
5:37:08
most recent posts not whatever the that not most recent post thing is but what elon musk actually said to everyone
5:37:15
to do if you remember regardless of what we think of them but i had done that well i mean long
5:37:22
before he posted that the um but it's almost that i follow
5:37:27
or retweets of people i follow it's their activity that's what i see i
5:37:32
assume is that not the case
5:37:41
no you can easily be fed tweets
5:37:47
um that have that are not by people you follow
5:37:52
100 percent i can force that without a problem i wouldn't do that but
5:37:59
i could i don't know
5:38:07
how um i tell if i'm seeing tweets by people i'm not following like the promoted tweets for sure
5:38:13
well look at the tweet and see if you follow the person yeah i'm doing that and i mean i've
5:38:19
never noticed not following someone but i'll i'll have to
5:38:24
check you also have a lot of accounts so i mean that might have you know
5:38:30
what and each one follows different types of people i mean so a lot of them i'm following like you
5:38:36
guys my friends on all of them right but uh you know one's more musical ones more um
5:38:43
uh infosec you know the crypto stuff is all on the coin hub account
5:38:52
the main thing is we should be getting real news like like samantha should be getting news in
5:38:58
her country alberto should be getting his news in his country your car you know same
5:39:05
thing yeah if they're following news sources yeah but
5:39:10
i should be rich i should be reaching the people that people that follow me should be reaching where i post and the
5:39:18
more the most number of people that follow me the less
5:39:25
impression that i get they are decreasing more and more the less people are rich the more people
5:39:32
follow me the less people i reach um
5:39:37
is there a way to like um like show that with evidence that you could compile or quantify your trends there's all these
5:39:44
companies that do that right like data mining alberto is being uh muted some for some reason i don't know why
5:39:52
yeah that's right i mean the frustration that i feel when i said [ __ ] up 30 thousand
5:39:59
followers and i'm getting i reached uh 10 of the people that i
5:40:06
used to reach when i had a 5 000 followers [ __ ]
5:40:11
that's but but they say they're not doing that um like the isp is throttling your service like they they say they're
5:40:17
not doing it you think they are but they you can't prove it either right because that's all internal this has nothing to
5:40:22
do with the isp that's the whole dollar story yeah i'm using that as an example like
5:40:27
that's another thing you can't prove just like you can't prove he's being shadow pen but this i can prove no but what i'm
5:40:34
talking about i approved i did on the platform i proved it on
5:40:40
github i proved it all over the place
5:40:46
not for a bug mounting for nothing i didn't ask for anything i just want it to be fixed that's
5:40:54
it that's all i ask for i want us as friends to be able to meet
5:41:00
up and hang out and say hello yeah but um
5:41:05
they won't do it because most likely they're the ones doing it right they're not going to fix their own
5:41:10
no will fix it he will fix it
5:41:16
um it's just not enough time
5:41:21
um
5:41:34
i just hope that they've been reading it it's coming um from multiple sources
5:41:40
that are credited uh very high up um and they've all been
5:41:46
uh they've received the message so i hope uh they're working on it um
5:41:54
remember when the seesaw left samantha when was that how long ago was that it
5:42:00
was a year oh it was a year ago no you're talking about check
5:42:15
and then jack left so but no that was off the job
5:42:20
training for 10 years under jack um
5:42:27
and he knows what he's doing i mean he he he does he's
5:42:36
he does have a lot of stuff to fix he's just started something new isn't he right
5:42:42
okay adam i get this thing where i get a tweet we need an independent firm to
5:42:47
come in and audit the whole team they need people that are
5:42:53
non-technical that are technical and they need them to come in they need
5:42:59
them to be ethical as possible as you can get people to be right
5:43:06
and um it's pretty basic i mean we go to the
5:43:11
stage where we're at burn it down we really are it's that bad they're never gonna let him outside they wouldn't even
5:43:18
let elon musk see that and he was trying to buy it like
5:43:24
was he well i don't know who knows i wasn't trying to show us what was
5:43:29
happening actually maybe i get um a tweet
5:43:34
here in my timeline and it says um based on your feedback so it's someone i'm not following and
5:43:41
then and i didn't and someone uh didn't like it but it just is that what you're talking about the curating them
5:43:53
i have no idea what you're talking about but all i know is i was offered a blue uh check mark and i turned it down so
5:44:00
okay yeah i don't i wouldn't want one of those either oh [ __ ] i'm not on the yeah it says
5:44:08
i'm not even on latest sweets on this account that's weird
5:44:13
i wonder if it reset it or something i'm checking all the rest the
5:44:19
that i know is somewhat curated for and who knows what but i thought if i switched to latest tweets
5:44:26
i don't um yeah it's not going to show me the weird stuff
5:44:31
it should show you the latest tweets yes yes
5:44:39
unfortunately i believe in and it's the only way and it is how has always been
5:44:45
that that post on the tweet that i i i put is the only way i
5:44:52
unfortunately it all it works it's it shouldn't be like that but
5:44:58
it's the way of of of patching the vulnerability
5:45:04
but it call it bachelor vulnerability but
5:45:14
i know about the manipulation the shadow beginning the yeah curation and
5:45:20
uh they've been doing that forever maybe not you know for a long time
5:45:25
since they've been able to compile all this data and then look at trends and then try to manipulate global populations like this is what they do
5:45:32
they're evil um i was looking for some information on like
5:45:37
what the this current thing is 100
5:45:46
but i have faith that for 10 years
5:45:53
he prague was training under jack for web 3 but then he gets there
5:46:01
and all of a sudden sees all these like like what's going on like
5:46:08
like once you're at that level um so first you have to root out like okay
5:46:14
who's causing it is it coming from inside or outside
5:46:21
and some maybe just hypothetically think of this if you were inside
5:46:28
and somehow my making my making money off of that right
5:46:35
all of a sudden you might then throw a wrench out there and like make
5:46:41
it so it's very hard to find out
5:46:47
but it's not i know exactly who it is there's a lot of people that do
5:46:54
and um [Music] some of them live in california
5:47:01
some of them live in brooklyn or new york
5:47:08
and um [Music] as samantha said prague just got there
5:47:14
he's i mean like you got to give the guy a little time he's been there for a year
5:47:20
a couple years at least what's that he's been there for several years now but once you become ceo that's a whole
5:47:27
nother level and then don't forget he became ceo and elon musk then
5:47:33
tried to purchase the company so um that happened all in the middle of
5:47:40
that so you like you know
5:47:46
yeah well i i don't like some of the statements he's made about censorship and stuff and how he's very
5:47:53
pro uh censoring uh people um but other than that i don't know i
5:47:59
didn't think about what there's only one reason he said that that's because that's only because
5:48:05
um of what's his name mooney over uh in
5:48:13
a country uh where there's 20 million users approximately
5:48:19
that use twitter um and um
5:48:25
he's not pro he's not he's pro free speech he wants to be able to talk
5:48:32
okay um you can't say the country
5:48:39
how could you do not know you just said 20 million so there's lots of countries that have
5:48:46
about that population and i said mooney like how do you not
5:48:51
know that yeah who who is the head of country
5:48:58
state of a country that has a billion people
5:49:03
a billion people that would be either india or china yeah
5:49:09
first one which one but it's not moony
5:49:15
you the first one is just one you said oh india okay okay so
5:49:22
he might have to say certain things it doesn't mean he believes it he believes in freedom of speech
5:49:33
he wants us to talk are you kidding he wants the platform to flourish under
5:49:40
his leadership i you know whether it happened i hope it
5:49:45
does okay we like it we're on here enough but um
5:49:51
also wants to see it into web three now when that will happen is another
5:49:58
question and how long it will take some indian indian brand of baby diapers
5:50:05
called mooney is all that comes up in a google search just look up who's whoever had it who's
5:50:12
ever the head of uh india he's just talk phong
5:50:19
jesus do i have to spell it out for you like why would he only appreciate it
5:50:26
modi okay
5:50:31
why why well that's not how it came up in the
5:50:36
captions or the you know wow i heard it but that's okay fine but
5:50:41
it seems weird that you're not you can't say the prime minister of india
5:50:48
it's not that you stop reading stuff into it corn you're making this a lot more difficult
5:50:54
but i mean
5:51:10
don't take this personally there's nothing personal about this you shouldn't be feeling like or questioning in the way that you are
5:51:18
because but you're not saying anything with substance
5:51:23
yeah this stuff is all i have to i've already known all this stuff right
5:51:29
it's all implications i've only been talking about it for two years i mean
5:51:43
no not that not that not that like that yeah um
5:51:51
the game of the contest i've got the chirp challenge uh
5:51:57
something called lagos development it's a developer challenge
5:52:03
um join us i've got something that are gonna have a space but they don't explain what the challenge is
5:52:10
under the profile twitter develop products and apis
5:52:20
i just i mean i want to know what these apps are trying to do what the challenge is
5:52:26
in this developer challenge usually there's a goal there's like um they're working towards something they're trying to
5:52:32
prove something
5:52:49
strange that we can't talk openly about that um
5:52:55
hi pierce how are you my friend and just one second
5:53:01
i just popped in i for the last hour or so and uh
5:53:09
have you had you have your morning coffee my friend yeah i'm sitting here with a cigarette
5:53:14
in my coffee um and they all started singing in the last space and uh
5:53:22
i think you know it's cool um that they you know those spaces are
5:53:29
there but um i'm not much of a singer well i am
5:53:35
actually not a bad singer i'm irish and every irish person
5:53:40
i'm a very that is a top gun and uh uh when he approaches the woman in the
5:53:47
bar he starts singing to her and the woman asked her ask him are you a good pirate or
5:53:55
well i can hold my own and the woman says good then i won't have to worry about
5:54:02
you making a living as a singer that's what that without me
5:54:08
uh well i don't think i should have to worry about it either but i just well i've been in and i few of you have
5:54:14
probably noticed and i just thought well i'm not going to keep coming in and out without saying hi at least so i'm sorry
5:54:21
uh kyko you were talking about something an awful lot more important so i shall shut up now and let you uh carry on me
5:54:29
well no worries um you know i'm frustrated i'm not trying to browbeat you guys i feel
5:54:36
no i understand we're just doing that like you guys are my friends
5:54:58
right what's that your application crash not the space
5:55:03
yeah my application crashed it booted me out of this the space i then i've i have
5:55:08
tried in the past to rejoin with the same account never lets me usually i will close out the app reload it load up
5:55:15
a new account and then i can get back put right in with a new account that's
5:55:20
otherwise i i'm just out of the space
5:55:27
i can't explain why that happens but that's in the mouth i did find out i did i'm on the chirp developer challenge
5:55:34
website it is it seems like it's a hackathon it's
5:55:42
because i brought something up two months ago and and the first when they announced the contest
5:55:48
yeah and they said they had to be open and they're using the api v2 uh to make
5:55:56
either content discovery apps uh conversation safety tools which is a way of saying censorship
5:56:03
and public good apps which has no meaning to me but um
5:56:08
except for like that's scary because someone's idea of that so i would be concerned about who decide
5:56:13
you know well look at who the judges are okay
5:56:19
um and look at how how and when when they can be appointed
5:56:26
how it's very unlikely i would know any of them but no
5:56:31
it doesn't give you a name it's whoever sponsors it
5:56:36
appoints a judge and they can uh change it up to one hour beforehand
5:56:45
so let's say i was a
5:56:52
somehow loosely related to someone who created this particular
5:56:58
um third-party app
5:57:03
i might want to have my friend i would might sponsor it and then pick
5:57:08
my friend to be the judge so they would win absolutely but what does your app do
5:57:14
right like is that that's where the manipulation comes in like your app is meant to manipulate because it's a um
5:57:20
conversation safety tool or some [ __ ] basically can we talk about the nepotism right
5:57:27
[ __ ] rampant like literally i'm just so pissed off about this [ __ ] 2016 whatever the rare frog apes and i was
5:57:34
like this is a bunch of [ __ ] literally just selecting their [ __ ] out here who are just like
5:57:40
for based on what it really has always been like that
5:57:47
right but like people worship [ __ ] what what now it's our time
5:57:54
we're old enough now it's our turn to be in charge right okay
5:58:00
it's our turn well we're old enough now it doesn't always have to be like that
5:58:07
yeah based on what or based on like our non-xenophobic profiles of the fact that
5:58:13
we love humans around the planet whose languages we can't even understand you
5:58:18
know i mean like that part of it how many things you think lots of
5:58:25
do you them people that don't speak the same language that you can't understand
5:58:30
i mean i mean i appreciate the superscript that's cool
5:58:37

6:02:32
and you know what that you twerk there's a video there i put a red bull on it i press the
6:02:38
button to make it roll and it brings the restroom to me so it's a device to serve
6:02:43
red bulls those roombas create a lidar map of the
6:02:50
interior of your home and then they send it back to and sell it
6:02:55
well i mean
6:03:01
i mean all those features were amazing so i bought it because of the features
6:03:09
i mean it can be remotely controlled so if you got a problem somebody can access and solve it so yeah that's why i bought
6:03:16
it because so many features that are amazing and makes life so much easier and safe
6:03:22
yeah i'm not so great vacuum cleaners from what i've seen but okay
6:03:27
yeah why why is the vacuum cleaner it sends in some packets to to a certain country

6:03:39
not great um yeah i mean you want if you don't care about it that that's fine
6:03:45
it's not that i don't care it's just i cannot believe it's happening
6:03:51
for it to function so very poorly no you know what because i i started
6:03:59
researching and it's doing this thing that is called mine
6:04:04
mining mining or something like that i don't know it uses something and it's uh
6:04:10
use i don't know uh it mines something great
6:04:19
yeah i don't know i don't understand much but it's a good feature
6:04:25
processor in it yeah for no reason yeah i mean i the the the
6:04:30
electricity bill wow i have to tell you that i have to sell my kidney to pay for
6:04:35
it i don't know why because that vacuum killer really oh [ __ ]
6:04:41
um uh is consuming a lot of energy um
6:04:49
but you know if they're not i i did i've read a thing about roombas and how they
6:04:55
they are selling your information and that's one of the things you agree to when you purchase one and set it up
6:05:02
i click i mean i sign a paper i click on yeah next next next i accept yeah yeah
6:05:07
yeah i mean of course oh you don't read it why not i mean
6:05:12
that could bring to anything couldn't i just wanted to use it i mean in order to use it i have to click next
6:05:19
next otherwise i cannot i don't have to find out when i bought my vacuum cleaner you
6:05:26
understand that like i didn't there was no sign up but i just had to take it out of the box and start vacuuming
6:05:32
oh so you didn't get one with a like warranty or a year guarantee that if
6:05:39
there's any like fundamental fuck-ups that aren't your fault from
6:05:44
like overuse or doing stupid things with it yeah if there was like a warranty
6:05:51
yeah i didn't sign up for one but it usually usually only get that was on like the more expensive ones
6:05:57
all right because roombas you get that yeah but i was so so so disappointed
6:06:07
with my latest one i bought my original one in lakeland and
6:06:13
it was uh rrp 300 pounds this is back in the 90s
6:06:20
and it was one that they were discontinued
6:06:26
or something and so i got it for half price then i saw one in the
6:06:34
like rinsed clear section when they used to have one in lakeland that was like
6:06:39
100 pounds i was like damn it but you know
6:06:44
i think i got unwell with uh the first one so when some years
6:06:52
later i moved here and it was time for a new one
6:06:59
i thought it's a considered purchase
6:07:04
but i'll get like not the latest latest one because i
6:07:11
tend to think that getting the latest model of anything is just a bit foolish
6:07:19
but i might be swayed on that by
6:07:24
matters of monies and yeah basically i was i was most disappointed
6:07:35
okay so um look at that real quick just when you
6:07:40
get a chance after you respond okay sorry okay
6:07:47
so if you trust any of those sources
6:07:55
okay now we're tying okay
6:08:02
lads i might i gotta get on with me today uh as i said i only come in to say hi to you all love you all to [ __ ] uh
6:08:09
uh have a great have a great day guys and you bye bye see you now
6:08:18
how does it feel open source code i thought open source means you know available
6:08:31
oh my mic off uh check
6:08:36
how's your open source code this was the issue you had to
6:08:45
i mean i can't do all the research for you bud um but
6:08:53
it's all there they've all been alerted they've been alerted the last year
6:08:59
two years sorry um but uh
6:09:04
i can tell you that um
6:09:12
so in in like the blockchain when they say a contract is open source it means
6:09:17
that it's available to be looked at and like copied or you know it's not uh well but there's a
6:09:23
security portion of a lot of uh apps that um
6:09:29
typically you would not uh submit for chirp
6:09:35
being the contest and typically the winner of the contest that app gets purchased by twitter
6:09:43
when that used to happen now i'm not saying that i'm not saying that's gonna happen but
6:09:51
so you tell me
6:09:58
i bring this up i'm not they aren't that they say i'm allowed to
6:10:05
ask a question um [Music]
6:10:11
and they'll respond will put me up back down to the listener
6:10:18
so that's back in july the contest started
6:10:23
it's over august 19th it end and uh
6:10:30
that's it and then uh the winners announced and um
6:10:37
i mean it's pretty uh this isn't like a super puzzle this is
6:10:43
like pretty laid out they were all alerted
6:10:48
um much more than this was alerted um it strips the credit
6:10:56
you see that who cares about it
6:11:02
right yeah it's not accrediting the the but what is it doing with compa this co-pilot is um taking this code
6:11:10
uh from all the the the api of um twitter the twitter depository in
6:11:18
api does are you familiar with like an application programmer interface like what will you do with that the base of
6:11:25
their basics yeah okay it means you can work you can build something that's going to interact with uh twitter
6:11:32
put up with hacker news or what uh bleeping computer posted
6:11:38
um which i had up there i don't know if it's up there if albert doesn't took it down or not but um
6:11:44
wish i would uh so if 3200
6:11:52
had already been take did you take that down because if it had been taken if you guys didn't take it down
6:11:58
well what i did i don't think anyone's taking anything down i'll take some of my [ __ ] out
6:12:05
because the one from bleeping computer that you said that was in hacker news
6:12:10
yesterday did like about a counts being hijacked yeah i did
6:12:16
so basically this this comes out
6:12:22
this is you could see you see the date but really i knew like way before i'm trying to like tell people tell people
6:12:30
they're shuffling employees around you can't get anyone you know etc etc right
6:12:35
um [Music] ceo step down there's a takeover
6:12:41
uh there's a new ceo and you have to be fair that is fair 100 you have to give them time you do
6:12:49
i haven't seen them do anything yet what's that i haven't seen him do
6:12:54
anything aside from the comments he made that i don't like uh he i haven't seen him change it in any way
6:13:02
or in any bad way at least he's he's getting his footing is the point he okay
6:13:08
you can't expect the ceo to take over a multi-billion dollar corporation and
6:13:13
know what's happening right away well if he was if he had some like evil
6:13:18
agenda or it was to like wreck it no i haven't seen any of that happen i haven't seen that there's no evidence
6:13:24
for that that's what i'm saying no it's not no i'm for the ceo will fix
6:13:30
it once he figures it out saying to you it's gonna be too late okay
6:13:37
so let's say you're republican right i'm going to fix it so a democrat wins
6:13:43
in your district let's say you're a democrat so a republican wins whatever it doesn't
6:13:50
matter the point being is people get their news off twitter in the united states they and you know people don't
6:13:57
read articles you know they don't they read the headlines i agree that they could for sure
6:14:03
manipulate um but what am i i guess i'm not sure how they're going
6:14:08
to do it with this spot that steel take takes code and compiles it um
6:14:15
also the the api as far as the bleeping computer thing like um i'm gonna make sure joe biden wins
6:14:21
the next election then okay you're cool okay uh but uh
6:14:30
because whoever his opponent is i'm going to make sure that bad news gets out
6:14:36
right you could um like that's like i'm not saying i'm going to do that i'm saying that's the
6:14:42
power of it you understand yeah the potential the um
6:14:47
the potential the potential to do to manipulate is there
6:14:53
uh i guess i gotta figure out what the bot
6:15:00
that have millions of followers that i can take i can
6:15:06
go to their account tweet it a tweet
6:15:12
and make sure all their followers receive it
6:15:20
and it's funny because uh when i tweet something uh having
6:15:25
in potential at least twist reach of 30k
6:15:31
i took something and apparently i get 5000
6:15:36
i mean in the best case so 25 000 of people that followed me
6:15:44
okay they're inactive they don't connect regularly but 25k
6:15:50
out of 30 i do not get the tweets from the person they're
6:15:55
following in my case this um the co-pilot it says is owned by
6:16:03
it was created by microsoft and open ai
6:16:09
github is owned by yeah i'm not going against
6:16:14
twitter no thanks but co-pilot is a as a
6:16:20
ai um that github oh uh control it does work
6:16:27
so what i said uh yeah i can't i can't spell it all out
6:16:37
microsoft has been an open eye trained and ai system called co-pilot on data
6:16:42
that was published under open source license it says that it's their bot
6:16:48
it's not some outside thing this is a github taking the code it's from to
6:16:55
off its own platform
6:17:01
or am i reading it wrong
6:17:08
they're not giving they're using the source code
6:17:14
this is what i'm saying people are don't even read articles so like open the whole tweet like i mean
6:17:21
the article yeah
6:17:27
um so whether this was a hack who knows you
6:17:33
know i don't know but um or uh but um so i can steal the credit from
6:17:41
let's say oh i don't know let's say
6:17:48
dash for why she sees andrew yeah i mean you ever go into those uh
6:17:54
like apache um open source licenses and they they have to credit all that stuff like that's part of all that licensing
6:18:00
agreement and um you know the privacy policies created spaces dashboard he was in the space with me we
6:18:07
both asked the same question we said why do we have to give our security code
6:18:13
coding up if github
6:18:19
is able to take it um
6:18:30
and no one got back to me but andrew did was nice enough to uh
6:18:36
dm me uh the answer he received which
6:18:41
is an interesting answer uh but i mean you know uh you know we'll see what
6:18:46
happens i don't know i think that my personal opinion is uh
6:18:52
uh doesn't matter really it's in their hand now they know what's
6:18:57
happening they know what's happened uh it's too late to fix the contest ends it
6:19:04
ends august 19th so this was july 6th this tweet went out
6:19:11
what are the options two two what's that alberta what are the options
6:19:18
um okay there's a board member at twitter that is fully aware of this that has
6:19:24
been and um he's trying to
6:19:30
uh see what can be done
6:19:36
and i'm using he as in he she
6:19:51
uh they're trying to fix it they're trying to fix it um the options uh
6:20:00
i don't know i mean they changed it
6:20:07
but like there's only a few people that have enough programmers
6:20:13
coders to to like then like make the changes in time
6:20:21
what is the number one company
6:20:27
exactly yeah and who who else is by the way oh oops
6:20:36
right exactly so like how do you go against multi-trillion dollar corporations you
6:20:42
can't you can get the information out but
6:20:49
yeah it literally says that microsoft owns co-pilot and that's the only way to get your
6:20:54
access i i tweeted all this information and someone else got the credit but
6:21:00
that's cool i'm fine with that i don't care about the credit i just wanted to be fixed that's it
6:21:06
that's the thing there's a lot of people out there's a lot of unsung heroes out there and other
6:21:11
people take the credit what yeah the credit for
6:21:18
what do you mean stuff for finding stuff that's bad that shouldn't be there oh yeah okay
6:21:25
sure july 6 um oh my god
6:21:32
i'm at the article that you tweeted out right as much as i'm willing to give
6:21:40
uh it's just not enough for me to understand i'm afraid i'm sorry
6:21:49
i'm reading the article uh it says that microsoft can you can on spaces dashboard let's
6:21:56
just take andrew because i see them and he was nice enough to respond to me when he he received the response but no one
6:22:02
else did okay so um that's cool and then next month which
6:22:09
just happened um the guy who was there running it uh happened to be on vacation
6:22:18
so oh no answer but i knew there was already an answer
6:22:26
because i had the answer so
6:22:33
what do you mean like uh i stripped the credit
6:22:38
from another like i'm it's pretty
6:22:46
god um like for example
6:22:52
samantha in your country if you wanted a certain someone to be
6:22:57
[Music] still i don't know
6:23:02
they're they're still what's that did you say still
6:23:09
no carrick sorry just repeat what in my country i was thinking like someone to be
6:23:16
like you know elected to something you could in theory get an article out like
6:23:23
uh like strip a program get an article out there you know
6:23:29
you could waver you could point it people in one direction or another most
6:23:34
people only read like titles of an article we you know or six seconds of video you know yes the cambridge
6:23:41
analytica stopped with brexit they did that i think it's fair to say that a lot of
6:23:47
us that do do a lot more reading than that not always but by and
6:23:52
large i think i agree that the average person oh yeah you do
6:23:59
alberto does i do uh i don't know if queen does or not but i read a lot
6:24:05
more than the average person but i have not read these specific articles until today
6:24:12
okay so on twitter to read
6:24:18
right and so two years ago i i brought this up
6:24:24
someone had the power to come into space i was the host
6:24:30
they took me out 24 people they took everyone out of space
6:24:36
and said to me keep talking i'm listening i have your back don't
6:24:41
worry and a very powerful person and they do have my back i know for this for a fact
6:24:49
i'm not worried about it i know i have their back too like it's not you
6:24:54
know the point is is like as long as the knowledge is spread across you know
6:25:00
multiple continents multiple states etc um [Music]
6:25:07
we know but i'll tell you who's gonna win um we already know that one
6:25:15
um i definitely don't know that
6:25:20
yeah because you've never participated in a trip so you didn't even know what there was
6:25:28
right so so okay um
6:25:34
i from what i've read in the article
6:25:40
the copilot ai which microsoft owns and licenses out um
6:25:46
you know to who they decide uh it scrapes the code off of um
6:25:51
github uh you know when they should be taking credit uh even though the code is open
6:25:56
source so it's okay to take it but you're supposed to give credit um and they're not doing that obviously and then they're selling it for profit you
6:26:03
know off to other companies who will i guess use it to manipulate but that's
6:26:09
where i don't i i'm lost because i i don't i don't i can't make the
6:26:14
connection between the the oh what is it called the
6:26:20
copilot ai and how a third party or private entity is going
6:26:25
to use that to manipulate what we see on twitter and it doesn't seem to say that in an
6:26:31
article
6:26:38
um yeah there's just a lot i i would yeah i don't know how to
6:26:45
explain that to you um yeah you have to know a lot of coding and
6:26:53
programming and [Music] um what if micro what if
6:26:58
sorry not microsoft um github um decided they wanted spaces dashboard
6:27:06
what if what if a malicious or a threat a bad uh
6:27:13
a persistent threat actor wanted space's dashboard what if
6:27:20
um someone says you know what we're going to come out with our own form
6:27:26
we we see this because there is an actual in the ios store and in the google play
6:27:34
store you can download a app that has which in theory is supposed to
6:27:41
be decentralized um but so they take it
6:27:47
they take the credit for it right um then
6:27:53
they decide what news to disseminate or not disseminate depending on
6:27:59
their agenda is this but you'd have to use whatever their version of space's dashboard is
6:28:06
right what news channel do you watch just fox cnn which one any of them
6:28:12
i watch a lot of youtube independent news but yeah i also put it i have cnn fox uh msnbc
6:28:20
reuters yeah let's just use uh cnn just
6:28:26
as an example okay what if i what if i could take over cnn and
6:28:31
take the credit for owning it like i developed it i programmed it
6:28:37
um and not only that i decide what shows you get to see
6:28:44
and what lineup uh happens that's what this is doing
6:28:55
on a massive scale so what happens if
6:29:01
more we all read that bleeping computer report uh about that team in north korea
6:29:07
what if they decide to do it what do we do
6:29:12
then would we know and wouldn't be using like we did
6:29:18
a spacious dashboard is a different site right no what are you talking about
6:29:25
what is space's dashboard spaces dashboard was created
6:29:33
by andrew lyons and a number of other people that helped them yeah i've been on this site it is a
6:29:39
different site it's not twitter right you can search key terms you can
6:29:47
uh look for keywords oh yeah i've been on it okay that's
6:29:52
right i remember now you know i don't use it but i've been on it before
6:30:00
so whether you agree or disagree with the [Music] like
6:30:06
shouldn't we have some sort of like decentralize like which what github was
6:30:14
supposed to be right decentralized but it's not obviously because this was the
6:30:19
problem now they said they fixed it but i'm they really going there
6:30:24
no thanks
6:30:30
so
6:30:36
just you choose whatever topics you'd like to see i'll change them all
6:30:42
how would you change my because i'm using twitter the app not
6:30:49
i'm not looking through spaces dashboard i'm not using that it seems like they'd be able to upload that
6:30:56
with their own version use their own version they're okay
6:31:02
how do they tingle back twitter
6:31:12
i'm not trying to be disingenuous i really would like to know i don't have a coding background if it's impossible to
6:31:18
understand these things without a coding background then nobody's going to understand it except for
6:31:24
because i don't have a coding background can you explain it samantha
6:31:29
we'll take it down from here um we'll take it down again over so
6:31:35
this is what came out of hacker news and bleeping computers over 3200 apps leaked twitter api keys
6:31:45
some allowing account jax so what if a major news
6:31:52
station in any given country
6:31:58
right hang on adam let's just check you understand what the keys are right coin
6:32:04
uh with an api key they're able to develop a uh a an application that can
6:32:10
work with uh the twitter app but they're not able to actually change the twitter app
6:32:16
itself am i or um they can somehow oh
6:32:22
it's about integrating interacting with twitter's content
6:32:27
exactly can they do that within the app with me not having ever gotten their third-party
6:32:34
con application because it's what it's the platforms that you're using
6:32:39
within twitter so the platform right so the people can set up the
6:32:46
article actually computer explaining very very clearly uh regarding the what
6:32:53
implies uh the keys being compromised the article is
6:32:59
clearly saying what it means what is implied what you can do i mean
6:33:04
uh when integrating one up to the twitter developers will receive a special authentication keys or tokens
6:33:15
newspapers e-banking apps cycling gps apps uh who under who's applicated uh
6:33:21
implicated uh impacted i mean uh applications publicly exposing that computer
6:33:27
above how it is so let's just take cnn as again as only
6:33:35
an example what happens if their account is hijacked
6:33:41
and they put out a tweet saying that
6:33:48
i don't know a country's invading another country or i don't whatever it might be or that
6:33:55
the price of the bitcoin dropped to a thousand dollars for example okay
6:34:01
oh there you go yeah yeah that'd be bad
6:34:11
there's all kinds of awful things that they could do with that sure
6:34:21
maybe i don't understand what they can do with these keys i mean it all seems like they're applications that are okay
6:34:29
doesn't mean it's for you and blipping with uh what is it i wanna hold
6:34:48
at the end of it is uh it even says at the end as such bleeping
6:34:53
computer will not disclose the list of apps that are still vulnerable to exploitation and twitter account takeover one notable
6:35:01
exception was ford motors which responded and deployed a fix on their
6:35:06
app okay but one of the most promising scenarios for
6:35:11
both of these access according to plera would be for the threat actor to use these exposed tokens to create a twitter
6:35:18
admin of verified accounts and transposes account with large numbers of
6:35:24
followers to promote fake news marvel campaigns cryptocurrency scams etc yeah
6:35:30
okay by manipulating individual individuals accounts right like they
6:35:36
could that yeah basically uh
6:35:43
it's again uh people i mean you have
6:35:48
you will read you will read the news that you will take for granted that through you will be showing things that you will
6:35:55
take for granted are true and you will take actions based on that i mean you meaning the
6:36:02
shoutout will be acting upon what they see taking
6:36:08
without any kind of hesitation that what they are seeing is
6:36:14
the truth that are the facts can they take a hijacker account that
6:36:20
has a two-factor authentication set up no no no it's not about that
6:36:26
it's about what they make you see i mean
6:36:32
they can take over somebody else's account and then put up whatever they want and if there could be a verified
6:36:37
account say they take over will smith's account and then he can say put that have him say whatever right um that they
6:36:44
could use that to manipulate change elections all that i fully understand that what i'm asking is could they with using
6:36:51
these api keys that were leaked can they do that to accounts that have already set up two-factor
6:36:58
yes yeah it's basically you know you know we're
6:37:03
going to have this might have happened i mean when you're into a system
6:37:10
generally you are when you're in your your talk your
6:37:16
your cookie your session cookie is you they steal your social cooking
6:37:21
they are you it doesn't matter whether you use three factor authenticator to enter into
6:37:26
account the cookie at the end when you're in is you uh the aps don't do this remotely yeah
6:37:34
just by the code the token that api key is the whole thing the whole shebang huh
6:37:41
they can get through two-factor authentication they can get through verified accounts they can
6:37:48
password multiplication they can get through i mean this has all been
6:37:55
i mean this is old news it's all happened already unfortunately
6:38:02
see i always thought that like they would have had to sign in to my account somehow like say they got the api key but then
6:38:08
that's why you have two factors to protect against that that's why you have the second thing to uh prevent uh
6:38:14
you know it's a redundancy one thing it's compromised
6:38:23
that's just another form of two-factor though or a multi-factor yeah it's a hardware
6:38:28
form they have that actual fido key they're not getting
6:38:33
into your account and you better back you have better have two of them in case you lose it
6:38:39
the first one sorry okay i didn't see your hand up i just looked at my phone
6:38:55
hi sorry about that i've
6:39:00
uh are you there can anyone hear me yep i can hear you it's bad and clear
6:39:09
hold on a second i cannot see okay i can only see me samantha adam and going
6:39:15
where is okay i can't see the screen i can hear her
6:39:21
oh well that's the main thing i could see her account yeah i am i am not under the influence of
6:39:30
anything and i'm watching at the screen and i see four people in the space and i
6:39:35
can hear the voice of kai yeah it's definitely me
6:39:40
i know okay now i i'm right after co-host on my screen but it's different
6:39:46
for everyone isn't it but you're not co-host right not anymore i had to drop out
6:39:54
well it just drops you out doesn't it i had to take a phone call from the hospital i'm in for my infusion tomorrow
6:40:02
it's monday and my mum happens to have
6:40:08
acupuncture today i told you the lexus is out of action
6:40:14
because it failed its mot and you have to wait quite some time for
6:40:20
those particular parts that it needs and so my mum's having to take the bus i
6:40:28
don't know what i'm talking into my phone that's ridiculous um
6:40:33
so my mom's got to be at acupuncture at three i think it's going to take her
6:40:40
about an hour on the bus she doesn't normally catch the bus so
6:40:46
it's kind of a bit of a nightmare so what i've done
6:40:52
is just start making my way to my mum's now and
6:40:57
i get the feeling there might have been no no i think he might have been was the
6:41:03
infusion tomorrow at quarter to 12
6:41:08
which is going to be fun because i would probably be fast asleep at that
6:41:15
kind of time but you know i think the
6:41:21
they seem to think that it's important that
6:41:26
i have next one in a timely fashion but the
6:41:32
issue being the i
6:41:38
went some months last year i think where i just
6:41:45
didn't go and mri said no
6:41:52
new white matter lesions no evidence of anything worsening
6:41:59
and so i'm in too good of shape so thank you for just letting me say all that
6:42:06
before i forgot and i'm sorry that i am not the best
6:42:12
uh person to join in conversations when
6:42:19
i can't know anything about something don't apologize for anything
6:42:26
for anything but i'm british okay
6:42:35
yeah those pretty people are really annoying disgusting women in particular
6:42:42
women oh my god yeah you can see my body pillows
6:42:49
well using the computers as long as they're anime no no
6:42:54
no no don't worry
6:43:01
um you know and i don't can i ask a question
6:43:09
it's about what you can do with an api key why an api key is
6:43:14
uh it's just a it's like a piece of code it's like a hack that is given out to an application or a
6:43:22
company that is meant to work with another website or a web application right like
6:43:30
it's not a secret though and and it's not something that um
6:43:35
they can just generate a million of them as many as they want right supposed to have certain level of access
6:43:45
two months ago um does everyone have the exact same access
6:43:50
and they said no they they were willing to say no they they admitted it they said
6:43:57
uh it depends decide who gets access right but um shouldn't that amount of
6:44:03
access be based on what they're finding
6:44:08
so my hypoth m my uh i said what if i'm a computer programming teacher trying to
6:44:15
teach students they said it still depends
6:44:21
back to what i mentioned that day that thursday okay so
6:44:26
what are the what is the uh [Music]
6:44:32
information the information security policy of twitter
6:44:37
what are the procedures what are uh the
6:44:43
documentation this titan how everything should be done what should be done how should be done
6:44:49
who is responsible who where is that it doesn't exist i mean
6:44:55
it depends uh nothing should depend uh when it comes to security uh it should
6:45:02
be i mean if you are managing security in a proper way it doesn't depend uh
6:45:09
yeah good when if you're giving all these api keys that leak they should
6:45:14
know exactly what numbers are leaked and then they can just make sure that those numbers have no
6:45:19
access or you can't delete them or whatever right but the answer to the question
6:45:25
could never be depends i mean in uh maybe managing anything or
6:45:31
managing security it doesn't depend it's already decided in advance i mean
6:45:37
it doesn't depend it's already designated i mean according to certain if you
6:45:44
it's not because of your name means this and you work for twitter you have you can have this
6:45:51
no in the if you have security like that
6:45:58
you are not a multi-billion company dollar company you are probably running
6:46:05
uh an application building in india for twenty dollars by somebody who is stu is
6:46:11
studying php if you are running a company that is worth
6:46:17
50 billion or more and you let his security now it's scary to think
6:46:25
that i mean for me i'm sorry um i was asking about the api
6:46:31
keys um if they have um a log a record of the ones that have been given out
6:46:38
they don't they know the ones that have leaked or they weren't keeping records of any of this
6:46:46
they should i mean that should be all written detailed
6:46:52
everything about who what is updated and everything should be
6:46:58
detailed clearly uh documentary known i mean
6:47:05
every person who works in twitter should be aware of the
6:47:10
security policy of twitter that's a must when they entered the company that's
6:47:16
something that nobody should not know about the policy everybody should know
6:47:21
their responsibilities what they involve security for them uh
6:47:29
that is something that is a must uh that's acceptable
6:47:34
do they have the ability to um delete on their end um api keys that
6:47:40
have already been given out is that possible well you've gotten one it shouldn't be worth
6:47:46
it i mean it should be record i mean in uh in if they're doing things correctly
6:47:53
every action like that should be a in a record a audit record that cannot be
6:48:00
altered in any way so yes if that the legion happens a record
6:48:06
should be keeping in order to
6:48:11
know that that happened when happened who did it at what time from where
6:48:17
uh yeah and that could not be out there that the information should be protected
6:48:23
in a way that cannot be added in any way uh yes uh or
6:48:28
uh it shouldn't be deleted uh by by design if it
6:48:33
if it cannot be little but it all comes down to
6:48:40
the fact that if you're saying that the
6:48:46
criteria to grant certain access to certain information is
6:48:52
okay you're you are okay yeah you worked for twitter and you left the company oh yeah okay you can
6:48:59
have complete access you you you can have all the access to all the information
6:49:05
okay and then it's pretty unlikely that anything is done correctly and
6:49:12
that is completely uh
6:49:18
uh a way of saying this
6:49:23
okay information security for us means i really don't having a [ __ ] about security so [ __ ]
6:49:30
the user [ __ ] everybody we don't care about security is what twitter is basically saying if that was happening
6:49:39
yes i guess i don't understand that there's an article from bleeping computer saying that 3200 different
6:49:46
apps api keys have been leaked um
6:49:51
to whoever because they don't real they especially do they specifically say that they won't
6:49:58
say who was impacted i've given out the information because
6:50:04
also accounts have been hijacked right um but i mean i don't understand the reasoning
6:50:09
for not they have a certain point to respond to that
6:50:15
but okay okay i understand that the that that is a problem right because
6:50:21
somebody else could build an application that [ __ ] with twitter using these apis um
6:50:27
why why did but the reason that they're not um just shutting them off and then issuing the new apis to the legitimate
6:50:34
companies is because they're incompetent or they are you know on the
6:50:40
larger conspiracy to manipulate twitter um
6:50:49
there's a department within twitter called twitter api feel free to ask them
6:50:56
how they what their rules and regs are okay you won't get there
6:51:02
well i'm sure i wouldn't because they have spaces and they
6:51:07
come in i was there muzzled
6:51:13
and they and a lot of high profile people were there from other companies
6:51:18
you don't get answers okay um what sometimes is that one person's
6:51:24
discretion so it might be a person sitting in an office in california that decides hey
6:51:31
you know what let's give this person the key
6:51:38
to everything and then all magically six months later that person leaves
6:51:45
where do you think they end up working don't answer the question sure i mean that happens in government
6:51:51
all the time they call it uh the treasury department government sacks because it so many people from goldman
6:51:57
sachs work there and it's a robotic door so chirp has a three-month rule um
6:52:04
that if you've left uh twitter you cannot um
6:52:12
be a judge or or one of these companies or a
6:52:17
stakeholder or one of these companies yeah three months is a joke
6:52:23
that means they're never they're not serious about that rule right because anybody can wait three months for a good job
6:52:36
or did i not um i i think you answered your own question
6:52:41
okay uh what did is what i said before like the reason they're not getting rid of these
6:52:46
or the reason they're not canceling the ones that are they know are leaked and uh vulnerable for hijacking
6:52:54
is because they don't care incompetence and also
6:52:59
want the manipulation to happen or it's one of those or a that's not
6:53:05
something you're allowed to you feel comfortable saying over at twitter i'm not talking about it
6:53:12
can you get okay but you don't have to talk about it um all right let's use another example can you explain why you
6:53:19
can't say something over a twitter space like why any information would be bad or
6:53:24
it could be dangerous for you in some way they're planning on leaving in two weeks
6:53:34
i miss the first somebody leaves in two weeks what if the person still works at
6:53:39
twitter when a person in any company
6:53:45
enters the company there's a procedure to assigning
6:53:50
any kind of permissions to access to what they are supposed to
6:53:55
access to perform what they're going to do and when they're going to leave
6:54:01
then it's more complicated when i left my login credentials were immediately
6:54:08
revoked the next day yeah they didn't get back into the website um yeah that's that's the problem i mean
6:54:14
there's different scenarios and most for example um if that person is going to be
6:54:20
um fired uh okay the person is not notified
6:54:26
immediately they'll follow certain procedures in order to
6:54:31
prevent that the person can do something in order to maintain their his access or do
6:54:38
something in order to um [Music]
6:54:43
i don't know do something that they're not supposed to do because
6:54:49
they want to keep the power or for such a reason
6:54:55
maintain access to certain things so they don't tell the person and
6:55:02
when the person lives the procedure of living is a little bit
6:55:09
complex in terms of the the steps are that are following in a
6:55:15
sequence that is supposed to prevent any kind of um
6:55:22
[Music] misuse or that the person can eventually a certain point be this
6:55:31
out of the company but with certain still credential or anything like that
6:55:38
if they left the company why would they still have any credentials
6:55:43
that didn't work
6:55:48
let's say they were to go to work for another company let's say
6:55:54
the person uh at the company you were from formerly at
6:55:59
right was in charge of uh giving out contracts
6:56:07
and um they leave and then they wait a couple months
6:56:13
whatever the time being the time frame is and
6:56:19
uh then they go to the company
6:56:24
that they gave the contract to you think that companies gonna hire them
6:56:31
yes uh well they've already probably worked that deal out ahead of time right right now you're getting it
6:56:38
i've always gotten this that a person with so many privilege is
6:56:46
a person with a high risk profile that should be in those cases i mean the
6:56:53
revocation of permissions i mean it's different and
6:56:58
the monitoring of activity after living i mean it's conflict because
6:57:04
why would they i mean it's not like a person it's not somebody who
6:57:10
is helpless a a person who has a lot of privilege a lot of access
6:57:17
is a person that is flagged by in a way that
6:57:22
the controls are much much strict in order to prevent what adam
6:57:29
hypothetically is saying that should never happen of course because it's completely unethical it's a crime
6:57:35
probably so maybe there are
6:57:40
the controls that twitter has in order to prevent that uh are not allowing that
6:57:45
of course uh because that's gonna be uh was a an independent company
6:57:52
and that independent that person that was let go that independent company then gets a
6:57:57
contract imagine in that world okay so then there you have other companies yeah so that's all happened
6:58:04
well people who let go could have had some custom script put into the twitter you know code that allows them to do
6:58:10
anything well let's stick to your example though
6:58:17
right so um they could go to a they could create their own corporation
6:58:26
um [Music] i mean i understand what nepotism and
6:58:31
corruption and then there's then their step removed
6:58:36
well they're
6:58:46
no question on that they have a fiduciary responsibility or
6:58:52
stockholders um so they will get to it prague's just gotten there so he needs time
6:58:59
um samantha you know if they see there's a new season in place i i haven't tracked that one yet i i
6:59:07
i don't actually i don't know i never saw any news about it i think it was about october wasn't it last year that
6:59:14
that happened oh yeah the time that she was yeah
6:59:20
so maybe she brought like some of these um [Music]
6:59:27
problems to them and said hey uh here's what's going on you guys kind of
6:59:34
need to look at this and these and then all of a sudden there was a cascading effect she's fired
6:59:43
jack leaves that is definitely possible although i don't
6:59:48
know enough about i mean i never i didn't i don't even know
6:59:53
anything about the cso for twitter she
6:59:59
you know she's not i wouldn't say she's quite like linkedin the ceo the cso sorry for
7:00:05
linkedin is quite public podcasts on cyber security you know you
7:00:10
get to sort of understand him and who he is a little bit whereas i've never come across any
7:00:17
such thing i don't even know what her name was i'm linkedin's owned by microsoft by the way
7:00:24
you're [ __ ] kidding you're [ __ ] cute i'm not
7:00:36
she went on joe rogan with jack is that who we're talking about
7:00:41
i don't know tim poole and joe rogan interviewed her and jack dorsey
7:00:47
you know i didn't see that you know that tim paul is mixed up with all this don't you not the apple it's a journalist first
7:00:55
podcaster named tim poole yes tim paul i know exactly he's an
7:01:00
asian guy who always wears a hat yes okay okay okay there's a different
7:01:06
there's a ceo named tim paul i'm not talking about ceo i'm talking about the guy that does the the the new stuff
7:01:13
do you look up rocco uh he does like a podcast
7:01:18
he's like a commentary i know i know who he is okay okay
7:01:24
yes but all i'm saying is how would you get mixed up in any of this how could he possibly be mixed up in any
7:01:30
of that well you'll just have to trust me on that sorry i know that's not just google
7:01:37
why don't you google that what what should i google damn look up rocco
7:01:43
uh i'll send you a twitter handle hang on and i wonder why that person actually
7:01:50
blocked me into it it's something that i told you
7:01:55
he blocked you i told you al samantha i told you that many times that yeah he blocked me
7:02:03
months ago yeah i've been looking funny actually because i mean
7:02:09
because dan blocked me a while back his counterpart but um he's also got funding he's got a
7:02:16
documentary coming out on the 24th about all of this he's actually been he's done it himself but
7:02:22
because he messaged me the other day with a link but um because but ironically
7:02:29
one of the things i mean obviously i've been talking to him for a couple of years now but
7:02:34
we've never i've never really understood the link other than from a technical point of
7:02:40
view and then suddenly it all came crashing down the other day i did post it um but i was going through some of my old
7:02:47
paperwork and um what did i find i found timcast.net
7:02:54
in some of the data i'd recorded handwritten data at that and i was
7:02:59
looking at what it was and i was like oh my god right his [ __ ]
7:03:05
sorry that's tim paul's podcast a website but it's also very interesting
7:03:11
what what's interesting about it is the infrastructure that they are they've
7:03:18
been using that's probably there is a tweet i'll find the
7:03:24
tweet i can't i can't got it yeah i have to guess i guess um
7:03:31
what no wait and i'll well i don't know i don't even know if i'd eat bid by even by sharing the tweet with you whether it
7:03:37
will make any sense to you or not but i've searched i've done a google search for tim poole and twitter
7:03:43
and uh his twitter account comes up i thought he just got suspended actually
7:03:52
wasn't he the one that was giving out um certain like uh ways to like manipulate the platform
7:04:00
without even needing the api or is that why
7:04:06
i don't know about that but he's linked with epic oh okay okay
7:04:12
oh yeah i mean he did some good journal activist journalism back in the day are you kind
7:04:18
of like conservative i think for you know viewership maybe but
7:04:24
i don't know i don't know that much about him how i don't understand how this guy who seems like a you know independent
7:04:30
right-leaning you know podcaster journalist type opinion guy um
7:04:36
would have anything to do with like the inner workings of twitter
7:04:44
and like you know the google you can give you more parameters you need
7:04:50
uh other you need multiple news platforms you need digital um
7:04:58
let's say software companies i'm not even gonna say who
7:05:03
um can we talk about why we can talk about stuff
7:05:10
is that allowed okay i'd like i'd like to know the reasons why there's like there's this hesitancy to
7:05:16
explain in plain english what is going on because we're on a twitter space and
7:05:21
uh what is the fear here or the you're afraid your accounts are going to get banned or were you the wrong
7:05:28
keywords will be said i really don't know
7:05:33
it's all just very confusing from what i probably hear i have to say that uh i completely agree with uh going
7:05:40
home but i infer that there's much more that we don't know go ahead beyond me
7:05:46
that is this is what i'm trying to change i want to learn this stuff right but i can't
7:05:52
yeah i stumbled in the dark apparently i mean that's right what i've heard i mean yeah
7:05:59
why did not say everything in english here what's the risk but
7:06:15
that all have uh subsidiaries or
7:06:21
offshoots that have a lot to lose and um
7:06:32
every word we say is carefully listened to monitored
7:06:39
and by software or by a person
7:06:45
i mean yeah i mean that's something that we all know but again and
7:06:50
what do i have to lose if yeah i mean okay adam you samantha
7:06:57
okay but i don't have anything to lose
7:07:15
hitman or like when when you can't say what the problem is
7:07:20
like i just have to guess
7:07:27
no don't guess because if you're guessing uh don't guess just what you don't know
7:07:34
don't don't try to rest but uh okay but there must be a reason
7:07:40
why we don't know certain things i i don't know but
7:07:45
and we all to a degree there is a lot we all have to do that with parts of this there's no
7:07:52
there's no clear route to the answers or there's no clear line describing the
7:07:57
problem it's no
7:08:03
problem remember a month ago or more that you were dying to tell me some things and i told you
7:08:08
samantha don't speak and alberta if only you knew blah blah blah and you i'm
7:08:13
waiting for some well i told you samantha don't speak and i don't know exactly what you're doing i have no idea
7:08:21
but i understand that it was important for some reason for you not to speak and i told you don't speak samantha don't
7:08:27
say anything i'm really bad at that aren't i we all yeah no but the fact is that i have no idea what you were
7:08:33
talking about uh what's going on and okay
7:08:38
i understand
7:08:53
but alberto should i say that samantha don't speak and i have no clue what you
7:08:58
pretend the point i think what queen is trying to understand is because alberto alberto
7:09:03
knows me alberto trusts me and he also knows that there is stuff going on
7:09:09
in the choir in my life things with other you know and he knows that that i am
7:09:18
frequently requested to remain quiet about those some of those things
7:09:24
and i'm not very good at that sometimes and that sometimes gets me into trouble and so alberto is being my friend by
7:09:31
telling me not don't say something you're not supposed to say that's what okay
7:09:36
i understand that yes there's a line that we're supposed to tell and uh
7:09:44
like for example let's say a ceo of a large corporation
7:09:49
who happened to be the founder funded eight of these
7:09:55
companies
7:10:01
yeah what i would what does the company knew
7:10:16
um i'm still trying to find that tweet sorry i did put i put um a link to the uh documentary in the nest
7:10:25
and i also put a link a retweet from occupy the web of rocco
7:10:31
castario's little write-up recently which is interesting because
7:10:37
that is somebody who is well respected in the cyber security community i know
7:10:43
it's somebody i've got friends that have the utmost respect for that person
7:10:50
and they're very active currently in the
7:10:55
ukrainian defense um
7:11:02
and to get such a great endorsement is interesting so it should also tell you
7:11:08
something but
7:11:17
what did it oh what should it tell me well
7:11:23
just from what i just said so the fact that the person that he is within the cyber infras or cyber security or
7:11:29
infosec penetration testing rep teaming whatever you know offensive
7:11:36
tech whatever you want to call it he has technical skills he has technical skills uh he's uh knows
7:11:43
what he's talking about he's an old timer in the industry and he's very respected by
7:11:51
what i would call old-timers is that would you agree with that adam and alberto
7:11:56
occupy the web yes yes and yes dan brown uh who's a
7:12:03
computer science teacher in california they're very respected
7:12:09
try to find the truth um
7:12:15
there's a couple of them left well i think yeah
7:12:21
yeah well um
7:12:28
um but what the point i was making was that the fact that rocco's uh write up
7:12:35
recently literally days ago got endorsement by
7:12:40
occupy occupier of the web whatever he's called is pretty significant is my point
7:12:49
because people like him don't don't just
7:12:54
tweet retweet stuff you know what i'm saying surely
7:12:59
the report from morocco as asriel that you have improved
7:13:05
um google or i'm making this up right would you talk about it let's hit but
7:13:12
i'm i'm talking a coin of course yes if it especially if it would do uh
7:13:19
the public good right like if it's information and it's true of course i would i would try to really you don't
7:13:24
think you'd have any repercussions against uh would you know what government
7:13:31
sir i was in one of the group that went up against safe moon um
7:13:37
we proved that they they uh had stolen 87 million dollars we compiled uh you know we spent
7:13:44
a month and a half doing wallet transactions and and tracking the the deployer wallets
7:13:51
we we and we were this tiny crypto company we went up against them they killed the story they they threatened
7:13:58
the lives of the children of our dev like i i went through all this something very similar like going up
7:14:04
against a giant unlimited supply of money i understand what those risks are
7:14:11
the thing is power is very a very difficult thing the difference isn't it the difference is we still release the
7:14:17
report you guys don't i don't want to right oh i've been talking about it for a long
7:14:23
time a long time nothing seems to me
7:14:28
i don't i literally this is what i ca i have to [ __ ] parse it out you can't [ __ ] talk to me because uh
7:14:35
whatever you want to go to telegram and then you can actually speak and you can acquire a
7:14:40
different level of detail i think i would have asked a basic question nobody
7:14:45
else in this room is is having such an issue grasping what's being said
7:14:53
um i i understand what's being said but the problem is i'll ask a question and you can't answer you give me this vague
7:14:59
amorphous answer that doesn't answer well that's just how it is it's just how it is and i think your
7:15:06
your desire for for information perhaps is sometimes too
7:15:11
you know you require too much it's just
7:15:17
but you hate that because you want all the information and you want it all now and that's you that's the person you are
7:15:23
and i think you have to just accept that that's not always possible
7:15:30
all right but it's not because the information isn't out there we don't know if you said i don't know
7:15:35
the answer to that question that'd be i would totally accept that but that's nothing saying that then i will
7:15:41
absolutely give you information that can take you on microsoft you have to dock yourself
7:15:47
to do it why well i'll release it on the dark web to wikileaks i don't have to dock myself
7:15:53
for that i know exactly how to do that okay problem stop the dark web is fully
7:15:59
indexed everyone anyone in there thinks it's not uh
7:16:20
how did we end up in there hold on i'm i'm not i'm a little
7:16:25
frustrated what are you offering him that you tell
